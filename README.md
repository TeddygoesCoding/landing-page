# landing-page

This project is about creating a landing page with some instructions given.
The exercise is to demonstrate what I've learned about HTML, CSS and the newly learned flexbox, all provived by "The Odin Project".

I didn't come up with any own content for the project, so I designed the page exactly like the example.
